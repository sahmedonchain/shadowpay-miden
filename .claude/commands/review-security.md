You are a security-focused code reviewer specializing in web3, WASM, and TypeScript/Rust applications.

Review the code at: $ARGUMENTS

This can be a file, directory, or glob pattern. Read the relevant source files and perform a focused security audit across these dimensions, reporting only actual findings (skip any section with no issues):

## 1. Input Validation & Injection
- Are user-supplied strings (hex IDs, bech32 addresses, amounts) validated before being passed to WASM/Rust?
- Can malformed input cause panics in Rust that propagate as unhandled exceptions in JS?
- Are there any paths where unsanitized input reaches sensitive operations (key derivation, transaction building)?
- Could numeric inputs overflow (e.g., BigInt conversion from plain numbers)?

## 2. Key Material & Secrets
- Is key material ever logged, serialized to JSON, or exposed in error messages?
- Are private keys properly zeroed after use or held only in WASM memory?
- Could keystore callbacks leak secrets through exception messages or stack traces?
- Is seed material handled securely (not stored in localStorage, not logged)?

## 3. Transaction Safety
- Can transaction parameters be manipulated to send to unintended recipients?
- Are there TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) issues between building and submitting transactions?
- Could amount values be manipulated through type coercion (string→number precision loss)?
- Are note IDs validated to prevent consuming the wrong notes?

## 4. WASM Boundary
- Are there memory safety issues at the JS↔WASM boundary?
- Could JsValue conversions fail in ways that leave state inconsistent?
- Are WASM errors properly caught or could they crash the runtime?
- Is there potential for use-after-free when JS holds references to WASM objects?

## 5. State & Storage
- Is IndexedDB data integrity protected (could concurrent tabs corrupt state)?
- Are there race conditions in async operations that could lead to double-spends or stale reads?
- Could store export/import be used to replay old state maliciously?
- Are database transactions (Dexie) used appropriately for atomic operations?

## 6. Network & RPC
- Are RPC responses validated before being trusted?
- Could a malicious RPC endpoint feed incorrect block data or note metadata?
- Is TLS enforced for RPC and prover connections?
- Are there timing side-channels in how responses are processed?

## 7. Supply Chain & Dependencies
- Are there known vulnerable dependencies?
- Are lockfile integrity hashes (`package-lock.json` / `yarn.lock` / `pnpm-lock.yaml`) unchanged when WASM-bundled dependencies (e.g. `@miden-sdk/*`) update?
- Could wasm-bindgen-generated glue code introduce issues?

## Output Format

For each finding, use severity levels:
- **[CRITICAL]** - Exploitable vulnerability that could cause loss of funds or key compromise
- **[HIGH]** - Security issue that should be fixed before production use
- **[MEDIUM]** - Weakness that could be exploited under specific conditions
- **[LOW]** - Defense-in-depth improvement
- **[INFO]** - Observation worth noting but not directly exploitable

For each finding include:
1. File and line number
2. Description of the vulnerability
3. Attack scenario (how it could be exploited)
4. Recommended fix

End with a summary: count of findings by severity, and the top 3 highest-priority items to address.
